# MARTA

## Introduction

MARTA is a web application that uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) to serve a simple HTML page.

The application is designed to run on a local server and can be accessed through a web browser.

The main entry point of the application is the `index.js` file, which sets up the server and serves the HTML page.

The application will display the HTML page served by the Express.js server. The HTML page is located in the `Untitled.html` file and contains the user interface for the application.

The server will listen for incoming requests on port `3000`, and any requests to the root URL ("/") will serve the HTML page.

## Setup and Run

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `nvm use` and  `npm install`.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
